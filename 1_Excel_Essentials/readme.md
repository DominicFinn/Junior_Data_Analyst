# Welcome to Excel Essentials 

OK this is stage 1. Some basic excel things. 
I'm going to be using the following files:

- product_sales_month_region_complete.csv

You can ignore the python script. It's just a tool to generate the data. Left there just to see how the sausage is made.

Please create a dashboard that shows the following:

- Total sales by product

Create some commentary on the dashboard that explains what's been happening.
