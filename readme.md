- Basic queries with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- Joins (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`)
- Aggregations with `GROUP BY`, filtering with `HAVING`
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions

**Example Projects:**
- Query a customer orders database to show average order value per region
- Use a CTE to find the top 3 selling products each month
- Calculate moving averages and running totals using window functions
